remotes::install_github("gwrecharge/rechaRge", ref = "main")
```

* Using `pak`

```r
pak::pkg_install("gwrecharge/rechaRge@main")
```

## Usage

Some ready to use data files are made available for documentation and testing purposes. This book is based on these examples, see the section \@ref(simulation).
