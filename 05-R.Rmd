# About R

R is a free, open-source software and programming language developed in 1995 at the University of Auckland as an environment for statistical computing and graphics [(Ikaha and Gentleman, 1996)](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~ihaka/downloads/R-paper.pdf). Since then R has become one of the dominant software environments for data analysis and is used by a variety of scientific disciplines. CRAN Tasks provides an excellent overview of existing R packages for a given discipline (see for instance [Envirometrics Task View](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Environmetrics.html); [Spatial Task View](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Spatial.html)). 


R offers numerous advantages, such as:

1. [Free and Open source](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)

2. [Reproducible Research](http://christophergandrud.github.io/RepResR-RStudio/) 
    + repeatable: 
        + code + output in a single document 
        + easier the re-analyses
    + scalable: applicable to small or large datasets
    + extensible: several
